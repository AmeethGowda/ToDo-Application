Microsoft To Do (previously styled as Microsoft To-Do) is a cloud-based task management application. It allows users to manage their tasks from a smartphone, tablet and computer. The technology is produced by the team behind Wunderlist, which was acquired by Microsoft, and the stand-alone apps feed into the existing Tasks feature of the Outlook product range.

History
Microsoft To Do was first launched as a preview with basic features in April 2017.[1] Later more features were added including Task list sharing in June 2018.[2]

In September 2019, a major update to the app was unveiled, adopting a new user interface with a closer resemblance to Wunderlist. The name was also slightly updated by removing the hyphen from To-Do.[3]

In May 2020, Microsoft officially closed the doors on Wunder list, ending its active service in favor of improving and expanding Microsoft To Do.[4]
